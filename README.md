# 🌳 Decision Tree Classification using Python

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on implementing a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python.  
Decision Trees are supervised machine learning algorithms used for both **classification and regression** tasks.

The project explains:
- How decision trees split data
- Difference between **Entropy** and **Gini Index**
- How overfitting occurs in decision trees
- Model evaluation and visualization

This notebook is ideal for **students, beginners in ML, and academic submissions**.
