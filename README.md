# Decision_Tree_Classification_using_Python
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree machine learning algorithm using Python. It covers the complete workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project helps in understanding core concepts such as entropy, Gini index, information gain, and overfitting in decision trees.
